# CRUD.ASPCore.Angular5.WebAPI.ADO
I am creating a MVC web application in ASP.NET Core 2.0 withAngular 5. We will be creating a sample Employee Record Management system using Angular 5 at frontend, Web Api on backend and SQL Server to fetch data from database. We will use Angular form with required field validations for the input fields to get data from the user.
